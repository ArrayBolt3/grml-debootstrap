TODO list for grml-debootstrap
------------------------------

* support tarballs for customization
* support automatic installation of grml packages:
  * grml-etc-core
  * grml-x + xserver-xorg [configuration of X]
  -> in progress... TODO:
     - set up /etc/apt/preferences so only the selected GRMLPACKAGES are taken from
       grml repository (currently all current packages like udev are taken from
       grml's repository) or use aptitude install $GRMLPACKAGES/$GRMLPOOL
* support selection between DESKTOP/WORKSTATION and SERVER (provide default packages selection)
* support for LVM + SW-RAID [should work through installation into directory, needs testing though]
* support rpmstrap (bootstrap a basic RPM-based system)
* support automatic installation of Gentoo
* provide zsh-completion for grml-debootstrap's cmdline variables
* support installation on usb-pen (like grml2usb for Debian)
  -> http://blog.256bit.org/archives/172-Debian-in-der-Hosentasche.html#extended
* support installation of grml-kernel
