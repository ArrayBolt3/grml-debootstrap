TODO list for grml-debootstrap
------------------------------

* support tarballs for customization/mirror source
  -> integrate/use 'fai dirinstall'?
* support automatic installation of grml packages:
  * grml-etc-core
  * grml-x + xserver-xorg [configuration of X]
  -> in progress.. (GRMLPACKAGES works already)
* support cross-installation (other architectures than the currently running one)
  -> like in http://www.netfort.gr.jp/~dancer/diary/daily/2007-Jun-16.html.en#2007-Jun-16-04:04:03
* support selection between DESKTOP/WORKSTATION and SERVER (provide default packages selection)
* support for LVM + SW-RAID [should work through installation into directory, needs testing though]
* support rpmstrap (bootstrap a basic RPM-based system)
* support automatic installation of Gentoo
* provide zsh-completion for grml-debootstrap's cmdline variables (in progress)
* support installation on usb-pen (like grml2usb for Debian)
