TODO list for grml-debootstrap
------------------------------

* support tarballs for customization
* support automatic installation of grml packages:
  * grml-etc-core
  * grml-x + xserver-xorg [configuration of X]
* support selection between DESKTOP/WORKSTATION and SERVER (provide default packages selection)
* support for LVM + SW-RAID [should work through installation into directory, needs testing though]
* support rpmstrap (bootstrap a basic RPM-based system)
* support automatic installation of Gentoo
* provide zsh-completion for grml-debootstrap's cmdline variables
* support installation on usb-pen (like grml2usb for Debian)
