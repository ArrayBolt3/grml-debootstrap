grml-debootstrap (0.18) unstable; urgency=low

  The "development sponsored by Sipwise GmbH" release.

  * Provide interactive configuration dialog.
  * Initial support for SW-RAID.
  * Use stages based on target information, this gives us
    the possibility to run multiple instance of grml-debootstrap.
    [Closes: issue510]
  * Use policy-rc.d inside chroot to avoid startup of daemons.
    [Closes: issue509]
  * Do not activate /sys by default anymore in /etc/fstab.
  * Copy /etc/network/interfaces from running system to target
    installation.
  * Setting password via passwd does not work, use chpaswd instead.
  * Remove stages after successful execution. [Closes: issue513]
  * Make sure the configuration file inside the chroot provides
    the same configuration as specified on the cmdline (thanks gebi
    for reporting).
  * Copy system's /etc/hosts to the target system.
  * Move stages to /var/cache/grml-debootstrap (thanks for the idea,
    gebi).
  * Install devices using our own device tarball instead of running
    MAKEDEV (which is just an ungly fork bomb).
  * Install MTA postfix by default to avoid installation of unwanted
    packages like citadel in lenny.
  * Allow use of comments in file /etc/debootstrap/packages.
  * Replace initrd-tools with initramfs-tools.
  * Run aptitude with --without-recommends option.
  * Run grub-install using --no-floppy, as requested by gebi.
  * Support setting hostname via cmdline.
  * Close issue in grml's BTS which showed up during development in hg:
    Fix handling of config file inside chroot, thanks for spotting, gebi!
    [Closes: issue512]
  * Update debian/ to make lintian happy.

    in some functions.

    only if it's available.

    questions when installing. (Thanks, formorer!)

    /boot/grub/menu.lst.

grml-debootstrap (0.6) unstable; urgency=low

  * Support Debian release with codename 'lenny'. Depend on
    debootstrap/cdebootstrap versions supporting lenny therefore.
  * Split all the code into separate functions.
  * Export LANG=C and LC_ALL=C as we don't have the locales inside
    the chroot when running grml-debootstrap. (Just a cosmetic
    change as there aren't any errors but warning messages from
    dpkg.)
  * Always assume architecture of the running system (overwriting
    via $ARCH is still supported of course).
  * Write variables from grml-debootstrap to /etc/debootstrap/variables
    and provide it to chroot-script.
  * Support stages. [Closes: issue151]
