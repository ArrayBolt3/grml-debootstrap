grml-debootstrap (0.7) unstable; urgency=low

  * Support setting some variables via cmdline.
  * Support full automatic installation via debian2hd.
  * Change logic of function execution and improved error handling
    in some functions.
  * Use aptitude instead of apt-get in chroot-script, but
    only if it's available.
  * Use DEBIAN_FRONTEND='noninteractive' so we avoid unnecessary
    questions when installing. (Thanks, formorer!)
  * Added additional check to grub code for running sed on
    /boot/grub/menu.lst.
  * Updated TODO file.
  * Use asciidoc for manpage generation.
  * Added basic zsh-completion (thanks, ft!), but do not install it yet.
    We have to adjust $fpath in grml-etc-core first.

grml-debootstrap (0.6) unstable; urgency=low

  * Support Debian release with codename 'lenny'. Depend on
    debootstrap/cdebootstrap versions supporting lenny therefore.
  * Split all the code into separate functions.
  * Export LANG=C and LC_ALL=C as we don't have the locales inside
    the chroot when running grml-debootstrap. (Just a cosmetic
    change as there aren't any errors but warning messages from
    dpkg.)
  * Always assume architecture of the running system (overwriting
    via $ARCH is still supported of course).
  * Write variables from grml-debootstrap to /etc/debootstrap/variables
    and provide it to chroot-script.
  * Support stages. [Closes: issue151]
