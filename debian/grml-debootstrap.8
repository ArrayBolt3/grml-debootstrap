.SH NAME
grml-debootstrap \- wrapper around debootstrap for installing plain Debian via grml
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B grml-debootstrap
.RI [ options ]
.SH DESCRIPTION
This manual page documents briefly the
.B grml-debootstrap
command.
.PP
\fBgrml-debootstrap\fP is a wrapper suite around debootstrap
(and cdebootstrap if you want) for installing a plain Debian
system via grml very fast and easy.

All you have to do is adjust a few variables in configuration file
/etc/debootstrap/config (or specify some variables via commandline) and invoke
grml-debootstrap without any further options then.

A plain and base Debian system will be installed on the given
device (or directory) then. Customization of this process is
possible as well.
.SH OPTIONS
grml-debootstrap supports the following options:
.TP
.B \-h, \-\-help
Show summary of options and exit.
.TP
.B \-v, \-\-version
Show version of program and exit.
.TP
.B \-\-grub <device>
Where do you want to install grub to? Use grub syntax for specifying.
Do not forget to set groot as well. Leave empty to avoid installation of grub.
.TP
.B \-\-groot <device>
Specify root device for usage in grub (corresponds with $TARGET).
Again, use grub syntax for specifying.
Corresponding with configuration variable GROOT.
.TP
.B \-m, \-\-mirror <URL>
Specify mirror which should be used for apt-get/aptitude. Notice that
specifying the mirror also sets the chrootmirror to the given value.
Corresponding with configuration variables MIRROR and CHROOTMIRROR.
.TP
.B \-p, \-\-mntpoint </mntpoint>
Specify mountpoint that should be used for mounting the target system.
Corresponding with configuration variable MNTPOINT.
.TP
.B \-r, \-\-release <releasename>
Specify release of new Debian system. Supported relases: sarge, etch, lenny and sid.
Corresponding with configuration variable RELEASE.
.TP
.B \-t, \-\-target <target>
Target partition (/dev/...) or directory (anything else without /dev at the
beginning).
.SH USAGE EXAMPLES
.TP
.B grml-debootstrap --target /dev/hda1 --grub hd0 --groot hd0,0
Install default Debian release (stable/etch) on /dev/hda1 and install bootmanager
Grub in MBR (master boot record) of /dev/hda and use /dev/hda1 as system partition.
.TP
.B grml-debootstrap --target /dev/hda6 --grub hd0 --groot hd0,5 --release sid
Install Debian unstable/sid on /dev/hda6, install bootmanager
Grub in MBR (master boot record) of /dev/hda and use /dev/hda6 as system partition.
.TP
.B grml-debootstrap --target /data/chroot
Install default Debian release (stable/etch) in directory /data/chroot (without
any bootloader).
.TP
.B grml-debootstrap --target /dev/sda3 --grub hd0 --groot hd0,2 --mirror ftp://ftp.tugraz.at/mirror/debian
Install default Debian release (stable/etch) on /dev/sda3 and install bootmanager
Grub in MBR (master boot record) of /dev/sda and use /dev/sda3 as system partition.
Use specifed mirror instead of the default (ftp://ftp.debian.de/debian) one.
.SH FILES
.TP
.B /etc/debootstrap/config
Main configuration file. You have to adjust it according to your needs
before you are able to run grml-debootstrap.
.TP
.B /etc/debootstrap/chroot-script
The script executed within the new Debian system as soon as the main system
has been installed via [c]debootstrap.
.TP
.B /etc/debootstrap/locale.gen
Defines the default locales used for generating locales via locale-gen.
.TP
.B /etc/debootstrap/packages
Defines the software packages which should be installed in the new
Debian system by default.
.TP
.B /etc/debootstrap/stages/
The default directory for storing information about executed stages. Every
single function of grml-debootstrap will write 'done' to the stages directory
into a file named as the function itself if it has been executed sucessfully.
You can adjust the location of the directory via configuration variable STAGES
via /etc/debootstrap/config.  Please notice that you have to remove the stages
directory on your own if you want to re-execute grml-deboostrap after running it
successfully once. This should avoid recurrent execution by error of
grml-debootstrap (which might delete present data).
.SH CUSTOMIZATION

You can control execution of grml-debootstrap via adjusting
/etc/debootstrap/config for some main stuff or via setting some selected
variables via commandline.  The packages which should be installed in the new
Debian system can be defined via the file /etc/debootstrap/packages.  If you
want to put existing files to the new Debian system you can place them into the
(by default non-existing) directories boot, etc, share, usr and var in
/etc/debootstrap/. Every existing directory will be copied to the new Debian
system then.

Etch instead.
