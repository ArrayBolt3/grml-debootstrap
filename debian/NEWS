grml-debootstrap (0.32) unstable; urgency=low

  Starting with this release support for the Debian/etch release
  does not exist any longer.

  Starting with this release grml-debootstrap uses Grub2
  instead of Grub-legacy (v1).

  To simplify handling for the user the configuration variable
  GROOT was dropped and the syntax of GRUB slightly changed.
  Instead of the old grub syntax style 'hd0' you can use
  '/dev/sdX' for $GRUB nowadays. You don't have to care about
  that if you are using the interactive mode.
